          <p>
            An Oregon native that is now located in Minnesota, I enjoy making
            movies and music about things that interest me. While my primary 
            interest is cinematography, I do also edit the videos as well as 
            the audio for them. My goal is to continue to learn and find my 
            own style and make indie films for a living. Being able to tell 
            a story visually is what I'm striving to do.

            I'm looking to do a lot more filming so I can really improve my 
            skills and learn by doing. I would be interested in collaborating
            with others who have a similar passion for filmmaking and want to
            create and experiment. Feel free to look at my videos and message
            me if who have any ideas for projects or talk movies.
